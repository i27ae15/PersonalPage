            <h3>E-Commerce</h3>
            <p>This e-commerce project was completely created on my own using Django for the
                backend of the platform was built with Django, which allowed me to create robust functionality for
                handling user accounts, product management, and order processing.
            </p>
            <p>The frontend of the platform was built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS, which provided a user-friendly
                interface and an efficient checkout process. I designed the platform to be mobile-responsive and
                optimized for speed, providing users with a great shopping experience regardless of the device they're
                using. 
            </p>
            <p>The project demonstrates my skills as a full-stack developer and my ability to create an entire project on my own.
