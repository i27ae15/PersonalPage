            <h3>Bubble Pop</h3>
            <p>I developed a fun and addictive game using Unity called "Bubble Pop". 
                In this game, colorful bubbles appear on the screen, and the player's task is to tap or click on them to make them explode. 
                However, they have to be careful not to touch the bombs that also appear on the screen or let any bubble live for too long, or else they'll lose the game. 
                It was developed using C# programming language. 
                "Bubble Pop" is a challenging and entertaining game that is sure to keep players hooked for hours.</p>
