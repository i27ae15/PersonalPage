            <h3>Web App Game</h3>
            <p> I Currently developing a videogame where you will be able to live any life you want, by the stories of you character being generated by a LLM,
                the decisions you make will affect the story of your character, being almost infinite the possibilities of the game. The game is powered by GPT-3 and GPT-4
            </p>
            <p>It's a very challenging project since I have to be able to adapt what a LLM generation to the game, that is not that easy, and also to be able to generate
                 a story that makes sense and is interesting.
            </p>
            <p>As the backend developer for this project, my role is to create the most important feature of the game, the communication between our end and the LLM,
                create the necessary infracstructure to be able for the game to have a "memory" so previous events can affect the future of the game, and also to create
                the image generaton process for each event that takes place in the game.
            </p>
            <p>The main features of the game will be:
                1. Almost completely freedon to live any life you cant think of.
                2. Be able to live in a rich and very detailed world.
                3. Be able to teorically talk to any character in a city of millions of users.
                4. Be able to generate images of the events that take place in the game.
            </p>
